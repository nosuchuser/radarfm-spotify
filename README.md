# radarfm-spotify
Set of scripts to scrape the radarlisboa.fm website and create neat Spotify playlists

Depends on spotipy, even if broken. Will fix this, some day.

NowPlaying.py When run continuously, will listen to the radarlisboa.fm feed and will add playing songs to a predefined playlist on spotify
