# radarfm-spotify
Set of scripts to scrape the radarlisboa.fm website and create neat Spotify playlists

Depends on spotipy, even if broken. Will fix this, some day.

NowPlaying.py When run continuously, will listen to the radarlisboa.fm feed and will add playing songs to a predefined playlist on spotify

This is the "clean" version of the code. The "development" code is much uglier but is able to deal with everything Murphy related such as incorrectly tagged songs and all general f%ckups.

If you need help setting this up, feel free to gmail me at brunotiagorodrigues@
